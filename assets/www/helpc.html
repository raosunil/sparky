<h2>CNMC Pain Clinic Pain Report App Clinician Help Page</h2>

<h3>Reviewing Question Content</h3>
<p>
    You may review question content without operating the app and submitting results in a WebKit enabled browser at URL
    http://SERVER/painreport/. Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari should work, but Internet Explorer may not.
</p>

<h3>Reviewing Patient Responses</h3>
<p>
    To view Patient Responses, go to URL http://SERVER/painreport/prdisplay. This will show a table of all patient
    responses. You may limit the results between and upper and lower bound by using URL
    http://SERVER/painreport/prdisplay?lb=LOWER_VALUE&ub=UPPER_VALUE, where LOWER_VALUE and UPPER_VALUE specify the range
    (inclusive). For example, http://SERVER/painreport/prdisplay?lb=3301&ub=3400 will show the 100 Patients with PINs
    between 3301 and 3400.
</p>
<p>
    The times shown on the server are in the MST timezone of Arizona since that is where the server is located. Arizona
    is 2 hours behind the East coast (EST) until daylight savings when it will be a 3 hour difference.
</p>
<p>
    There are some columns like "Is Android?" and "Is Completed?" that are there for future use. You can toggle
    "Is Completed?" now but it will not do anything. It is there for future use to allow a clinician to indicate
    a Patient has completed the number of trials. At this time there is no limit to the number of trials.
</p>
<p>
    You may however add a new Patient using the dialog at the bottom. The app has been pre-provisioned with the
    PINs specified to me in December 2013, but you may add additional ones (provided the PIN is unique) here.
</p>
<p>
    We realize the server display is very crude and lacks an ability to export data. We are aware of this and will
    put up a better UI over our winter break.
</p>

<h3>Checking Patient Next Reading Time</h3>
<p>
    If a Patient is frustrated because s/he thinks a reading is due but keeps getting an error that it is not,
    then you can check by going to URL
    http://SERVER/painreport/primport?PIN=XXXX where SERVER is the server and XXX is the PIN number.
    <br/>
    If you think there is an error with the time (keep in mind it is MST) then contact ASU.
</p>

<h3>Dealing with Errors</h3>
<p>
    Of course ASU will help with troubleshooting errors, but there are a few things you should know ahead of time
    in case they arise. It is also helpful to familiarize yourself with the
    <a href="./help.html">Patient help</a> especially the Known Bugs and Workarounds section.
    <br/>
    <UL>
    <LI>If the Patient has a phone running Android version 3.x, it will likely not work.</LI>
    <LI>The image question goes off the screen.</LI>
    <LI>The Patient may get a reminder when s/he should not get one. They can always clear reminders
        from their Notifications bar.</LI>
    <LI>The Patient must complete the survey in one sitting, and must have a stable network
        connection when s/he starts and finishes (but not necessarily in between). We recommend not
        taking the survey when riding in a car as the service can be intermittent.</LI>
