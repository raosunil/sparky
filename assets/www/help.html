    <title>CNMC Pain Report App Help</title>
</head>
<body>
This is a simple help file for the CNMC Pain Report Application. <br/>
NOTE: In the below, SERVER in all CAPS refers to wherever the server-side components are installed.

<h3>Setting up an Android Phone</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Install the .apk file from an email link or from the web URL http://SERVER/painreport/PainReport.apk.
        As this is not through the Google Playstore, the phone may ask for special permissions. Further,
        if the phone is a newer phone, you may have to go into the phone's settings to allow the download
        and to allow the app to give notifications to take the survey.</li>
    <li>When first executing the app, you will see a welcome page that will say "NO SERVER" and "NO PIN".
        You must do the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Hit the Android phone's preferences button</li>
            <li>Tap on "Settings" or "Preferences" (one of these will come up)</li>
            <li>Tap PIN. In the dialog enter the patient's assigned 4-digit PIN</li>
            <li>Tap Server. In the dialog enter the SERVER</li>
            <li>Hit the Back button on the phone. You should see the Pin and Server
                values you just entered in place of NO PIN and NO SERVER</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The clinician and patient should run the app the first time together. See "Operating the App" below</li>
    <li>There are a few selected versions of Android for which the app may not properly operate. This may happen
        in approximately 1 in 40 installs. If there is a problem installing or running the application, contact
        Dr. Gary. Be sure to get the exact Android version and phone model number from the Settings menu
        of the phone.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Operating the App</h3>
<p>
To run the app, simply tap on it from your Android apps menu. We recommend placing it on your home screen so it is
readily available and you remember to perform the survey.
</p>
<p>
    After starting the app, you should see the welcome screen with your PIN and SERVER as set up the first time
    you ran the app with your clinician. If you see NO SERVER and/or NO PIN, please follow the instructions in
    the Installation section for setting these properties.
</p>
<p>
    When you click "OK" on the first screen, you should be taken to a welcome page giving you a briefing on
    the app and a "Get Started" button on the bottom. Note you must have an active cellular connection with
    data, or a WiFi connection, to have the OK button work. If you do not, you will get an error message.
    Also, if you are not due to take a survey yet, then if you click on the OK button and get a message saying
    a reading is not due yet, then close the app and wait until the reading is due. If you continue to get this
    message and believe it is in error, then please contact your clinician.
</p>
<p>
    Once you tap "Get Started" you will enter the survey questions. It is intended that you answer all of the
    survey questions in one sitting. For this reason the Back button on your device is disabled while you
    answer the questions. It is OK if you encounter a short disruption such as receiving a phone call or a
    text message, but if you pause using the app for an extended period of time the survey answers will be
    discarded and you will have to start over again. Further, make sure you are in an area with a stable
    network connection (cellular or WiFi) as the app will require such a connection when it starts and most
    importantly when it completes.
</p>
<p>
    Once you enter the survey, you will not be able to proceed to the next question until you answer the current
    question. Then the grayed out Next button will be enabled. You may at any time go back to the previous question
    using the Prev button. Your answer is immediately saved anytime you use the Prev or Next buttons. Upon
    completion of the last question, you will be taken to a debriefing page and asked to re-enter your PIN.
    If you enter the proper PIN you will be asked to Submit. If your responses are received by the server, you
    will be informed and a Close button will appear (which you should tap). If there is an error in PIN entry
    you will not get the Submit button. If there is a network error or the server does not think your responses
    are due yet, then you will get an error message. If this happens DO NOT TAP THE CLOSE BUTTON, instead retry
    your submission.
</p>

<h3>Known Bugs and Workarounds</h3>
<p>
    <UL>
    <LI>If you are in the middle of taking a survey, and the Notification to take a survey appears in the Notification
        bar, then you should clear it. If you tap on it while the survey is active, it will appear to take you back
        to the Welcome screen. However, you can click your device's Back button and you will be returned to the
        survey at the place you left off.</LI>
    <LI>It is possible to navigate past some questions without answering those questions. When this happens you will
        be notified on the submission page of the app to go back and answer these questions.</LI>
